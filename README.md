# Setup

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/aboglioli/survival.git
```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/

## 3. Install Webpack and dependencies:

Navigate to the cloned repo’s directory.

Run:

```
npm install webpack -g
```

and

```
npm install
```

## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser.


## Compile for deployment:

Run:

```
npm run deploy
```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
